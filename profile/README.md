## The Problem

**DeFi yield opportunities remain inaccessible to most people due to:**

- Complex user experience with wallets, gas fees, and Web3 terminology
- Overwhelming number of protocols with varying risks and returns
- Difficulty assessing protocol safety and understanding yield sources
- Complicated tax reporting and fund tracking across multiple platforms

## Our Solution

PolyStream is a **yield aggregation platform designed specifically for Web2 users new to DeFi**. We eliminate complexity by abstracting away the technical barriers that prevent mainstream adoption.

## Key Features

### üì± Web2-Friendly User Experience
- **No wallet required** to start - create an account with email powered by Privy.
- **Seamless fiat on/off ramp** - deposit with credit card or bank transfer powered by Transak.
- **Zero gas fees** visible to users - we handle all transaction complexity leveraging Chainlink.
- **Simple, intuitive interface** designed for crypto newcomers.

### üõ°Ô∏è Smart Yield Aggregation
- **Automatic allocation** across multiple protocols (Aave, LayerBank, SyncSwap)
- **Risk-adjusted returns** to maximize yield while managing exposure
- **Dynamic rebalancing** as market conditions change
- **Protocol diversification** reduces single protocol risk

### üîç AI-Powered Risk Assessment
- **Real-time protocol monitoring** with risk scoring
- **Automated security audits** of underlying protocols
- **Transparent risk reporting** in simple, understandable terms
- **Early warning system** for potential vulnerabilities

### üìä Portfolio Management
- **Unified dashboard** for all yield-generating assets
- **Performance tracking** with detailed analytics
- **Tax reporting tools** for simplified compliance
- **Scheduled deposits** for dollar-cost averaging

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** with just an email - no crypto knowledge required
2. **Deposit funds** using familiar payment methods
3. **Choose your risk profile** (conservative, balanced, growth)
4. **Watch your assets grow** as we optimize yield across protocols
5. **Withdraw anytime** back to your bank account

## Technical Architecture

PolyStream is built on a robust multi-protocol framework:

- **Smart Contract System**: Secure vault contracts manage assets across multiple DeFi protocols
- **Protocol Adapters**: Standardized interfaces to connect with Aave, LayerBank, SyncSwap, and more
- **Risk Management System**: Continuous monitoring and adaptive allocation based on protocol health
- **Gas Optimization**: Transaction batching and strategic execution for maximum efficiency

## Supported Protocols

Our platform currently integrates with:

- **Aave V3**: Leading lending protocol with strong security track record
- **LayerBank**: Optimized lending on Layer 2 with competitive rates
- **SyncSwap**: Liquidity provision with automated rewards

*We continuously evaluate and add new protocols based on our rigorous security standards.*

## Security First

We prioritize the safety of user funds above all:

- **Multi-layered security** with strict protocol selection criteria
- **Conservative allocation strategy** favoring established protocols
